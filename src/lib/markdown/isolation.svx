Project Isolation was a singleplayer open-world FPS game, a rearchitecture of Fall Blau, leveraging many new skills and technologies I had learned in the interrim. The project was abrubtly cancelled upon the relase of <u><a href="/fpscore" target="_self">FPS Core</a></u>, which took priority due to it's success.

Project Isolation was the first game development project I approached with a more professional mindset. I used git for version control, planned out features in advance, and actually thinking about the mechanic I wanted to add before implementing them. It was also a significant technical step forward for me, with a full C++ core and advanced mechanics, such as an expanded moveset and weapon attachments.

To raise awareness of the game and provide progress updates to potential players, I also produced a 4-episode series of devlogs on YouTube, walking viewers through my creative and technical process. You can find my favourite of these episodes <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdP_yObwOe4">here</a></u>.

During it's development, I maintined Project Isolation's github repository, with the intention of making it easier for other people to use the code to build their own games. I decided in mid-2022 to instead turn the project into a plugin, to make it a drop-in solution for anyone looking for a robust FPS system. This necessitated a minor rearchitect of the project, and ultimately resulted in <u><a href="/fpscore" target="_self">FPS Core</a></u>, which due to it's succes superceded Project Isolation and became my new focus.
